# Deep_photo_styletransfer
Style transfer is a computer vision technique that allows us to recompose the content of an image in the style of another.To create artistic images of high perceptual quality.
This new capability opens up endless doors in design, content generation, and the development of content creativity tools.It can be used in photo video editors, Artist-community 
engagements, commercial art gaming and virtual reality , there are many other ways in which style transfer 
is shaping our future.

This method takes two images:an input image which is usually an ordinary photograph and a reference style image.
This approach augments the Neural Style algorithm by introducing two core ideas:
A photorealism regularization term is used in the objective function during the optimization,constraining the reconstructed image to be represented by locally affine color transformations of the input to prevent distortions.
Semantic segmentation of the inputs is used to avoid the content mismatch problem which greatly improves the photorealism of the results.
